# thingymodulecreate
This is the base repository for our cli tool.

Generally the base repository consists of 3 relevant parts.

1. toolset submodule - here I the shared build system ;-)
2. sources submodule - here is all information relevant for building the cli
3. output submodule - this is what currently is deployed on npm

Cheers!
